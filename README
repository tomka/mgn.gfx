Moregoodnews graphics library
=============================

This library is currently meant as a graphics related playground
for the D language (version 2).


Folder structure
================

The folder structure is as follows:

    \src        source files
    \samples    some samples


Building
========

To build the library and examples you need a D2 compiler. DMD
(Digital Mars D compiler) is such a thing and the one we tested
the code with. You can grab it at [1]. To build the library by
hand, just call dmd with all the source files and either the -c
(no linking) or the -lib (library) option. The result can then
be linked against the actual source code using the library. Of
cause you could do that all in one call by supplying the correct
include path (-I option) as well.

Alternatively you can use cmake with the cmaked2 module [2].
CMakeLists.txt files are supplied for the library and samples.
Beware, you need at least cmake 2.8.1 for that to work and you
might need to specify the D compiler by hand with adding the
following to the dmd call (fit the path your needs):

    -DCMAKE_D_COMPILER=/usr/bin/dmd

We recommend making a build directory in the root of this
repository and building from there:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_D_COMPILER=/usr/bin/dmd

That way cmake won't pollute the source tree.
